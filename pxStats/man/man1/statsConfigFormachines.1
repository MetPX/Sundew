.LP 
The field in the middle is the machine or list of machines that is associated with the tag specified on the left.
.LP 
The field on the outter right is the list of logins to be used for the list of machines specified in the middle of the line. The number of logins MUST match the number of machines found on that line even if a user name was specified on a preceding line for that same machine.
