****IMPORTANT NOTES :
.TP 
This is the only way to use this program at the moment. 
.TP 
This program is built in a way that it is expected to be run at least once per hour. Running it more often isn't really desirable but will not be harmfull. 
.TP 
Problems in the graphics shown in the web pages will appear if this program is not run every hour.
.TP 
This file is being called automatically by the launchGraphCreationprogram. Thus if launchGraphCreation is run properly, this program should barely, if ever, be used directly.
