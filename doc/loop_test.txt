-- install it. (see INSTALL)
   -- there should now be a /apps/px tree, and a user named px.
   -- set the password for the px account, and su - px
   -- add /apps/px/bin to your path e.g. export PATH="${PATH}:/apps/px/bin"

-- create two receivers:

/apps/px/etc/rx/file.conf
--
type bulletin-file
extension file:-CCCC:-TT:-CIRCUIT:Direct
--

/apps/px/etc/rx/loop.conf
--
type wmo
port 5002
extension pxatx:-CCCC:-TT:-CIRCUIT:Direct
--

and a transmitter:

/apps/px/etc/tx/loop.conf
--
type wmo
destination wmo://localhost:5002
imask *:*:*:*:*:*:*
--

/apps/px/etc/pxRouting.conf
--
SACN37 CWAO:loop:3
SACN31 CWAO:loop:3
SICN25 CWAO:loop:3
SANT31 CWAO:loop:3

touch /apps/px/etc/stations.conf  # just needs to exist...

px start

look at /apps/px/log

there should be three log files, and they should indicate normal startup.

In the distribution, there is a testSuite directory:

cd /apps/px/rxq/file/
cp <wherever>/testSuite/01TwelveHoursOld/input/* .

That will copy a selection of bulletins into the file receivers input queue.
they will be ingested (look at rx_file.log) and queued for transmission via the
wmo client.   

The loop sender client is connected to the loop reception client at localhost.  
The sender will send the bulletins.  
The receiver will receive the bulletins, and route them to the sender (a looping 
configuration, normally a bad thing) 
The sender will notice that it has sent the messages recently and drop the bulletins.

So from this you can see a very simple installation configuration self-test.

To make run a little longer, You can turn off duplicate message detection
in the wmo sender by adding

noduplicates false

to /apps/px/etc/tx/loop.conf

then it will circulate the data forever.
