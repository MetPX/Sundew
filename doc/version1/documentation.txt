  -- revamp coding standard.
        -- doc/StyleGuide.txt should be created.
        -- move 'authorship' to start of file, alone. not every routine.
           If a file has more than one author major, list all at top (once)
        -- scope (public vs. private) of a routine is revealed by it's name

        -- at least the documentation in English (required for open sourcing.)


  -- Extract all the TIKI stuff .. dump it into docs/specs... or some developer manual.
     sub-dir like requirements/Spec/Design.?

  -- documentation needed.
	-- Have the README's collected into man pages.

		Someone needs to write a basic routing section.
			-- Receiver  -- role determine: key for lookup & ingest file name.
			-- pxRouting -- determine appropriate routing based on key.
			-- Sender   -- chooses to send items based on ingest file name & 
				       prioritization scheme.


		AMB needs to write an advanced routing section...
			-- create a pretend model of our configuration with all the complexities.
			-- multiple sources for the same data, routing the same data to different
			   destinations based on its origin.

		canned configurations to go with the basic and advanced routing sections.
			a basic loop-back, and a glorious loop-back...

		MG ... advanced filtering
			-- how to products routed for processing, a la FHS.
			-- include collection processing.
