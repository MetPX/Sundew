  -- end to end performance testing.

  -- student project... directory watching technique study.
	-- opendir poll, versus, poll mtime, FAM, fcntl(D_NOTIFY, fcntl(I_NOTIFY)
	-- make a something to tickle the directory to test it.
	-- test resource usage & responsiveness of all methods.
		-- when the directory is almost always empty
		-- when the directory is getting multiple files per second.

  -- student project:
	-- add sftp support into curl.
	-- just work with the open source project and modify it.

  -- student project:
	-- see if there is bandwidth control in curl, and if not
	   see if we can add it.

  -- performance improvement, worklists...
     drop off worklists in the q directories, rather than linking files...
     reduces overhead... ie... receiver builds a list of files to q for each
     client places the list in /apps/px/txq/q<source>_<unique>
 
     Senders then read the names in all the q files, and perform the normal
     priority sort.

     faster than linking each file under heavy load, much less file system 
     interaction.  test!?
