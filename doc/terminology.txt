Terminology/Glossary:


Historical notes:

The documentation is spotty, and often makes reference to older systems within Environment Canada.
The historical notes give some clue as to what the heck we are talking about.

NCS -- National Communications System  (And National Central Communications System) aka APPS
    -- a predecessor of MetPX.  
    -- applications written in a proprietary language for a proprietary OS, non-portable.
    -- for bulletin switching.
    -- excellent features for intended purpose, but decades old and now obsolete.

PDS -- Product Distribution System.
   -- a predecessor of MetPX.  Still in heavy use within Environment Canada.
   -- only intended for file transfers, not bulletins.
   -- application in C, no plans to release it.
   -- metpx has lower switching latency, higher delivery performance, and lower overhead.
   -- was the design point from which metpx arose.

Originally, MetPX-Sundew was called pds-nccs, with the idea being to create small modules
that would permit a standard PDS to send and receive over sockets.  At this point, the
receivers and senders were called NCSamReceiver, or NCSWmoReceiver as they were to bolt
onto a PDS.  This was brought into a full-scale mockup configuration, and it failed 
miserably.  The latency and performance of the PDS was not upto the task.  At that point,
a trial project was initiated to re-implement a minimal subset of the PDS to support the 
PDS-NCCS project.  The tiny (500 line) prototype was the File Exchange Tracker (FET).  
Those trials were successful (order(s) of magnitude improvements in latency and performance.)
It lived only a month or two as an independent module.

The separate individual configuration of many, many individual components was cumbersome
and fraught with chances for error by administrators.  In order to make the package easier
to configure, a standardized file tree was designed, and FET and pds-nccs were thus merged 
with a common, simpler configuration.   The result of that was the original product exchanger 
(PX.)

Columbo -
An operator interface for the PDS, called Columbo, had been created.  This interface
was extended to support both PDS and PX.  

Eventually, the interface was subsumed as part of the overall MetPX project, so the switching
component was renamed from px to Sundew.

PX -- Product Exchanger

Circuits are established relationships with other machines.
Circuits are unidirectional and can be divided into two types:
We receive products from 'source' circuits and deliver products
to 'client' circuits.

The term circuit is used loosely, as in this case it applies
to file reception and delivery as well as traditional permanent
connections.

Directions:
all directions are relative to the entire machine, not any sub-component.
if files are on their way into the machine, they are rx (reception) files.
if they are on their way out from the machine, they are tx (transmission) files.

sample confusion to be avoided:
ie. PDS has 'incoming' as the name of the files which are outgoing from the server,
because they are 'incoming' to the client.  Such a directory name is very confusing.

Clients:
     locations to which products are delivered.
     same terminology as the PDS.

sources 
     one (or more, depends on priority setting in config.)
     places where files can be received.

Reception Name:
     Files are received with a "reception name" in the rxq.
     once the reception name is adjusted via a ('whattopds') type
     mapping, then the ingestname is generated from that.

Ingest Name:
     Ingest name is used to store the file in the DB, as is.

     for patterned routing (see below):
     ingest name is mapped against patterns to find clients who 
     will be sent the file.

Destination File Name:
     destination file name, destfn, is calculated:
     default is first field of ingest name.
     add suffixes according to DESTFN parameter setting in pattern.

Direct Routing:
     routing using a lookup table, tandem style, with direct correspondence
     between source and client. 

Pattern Routing:
     traditional PDS routing, via emasks & imasks
