                                  update paths used when PXROOT used
                                  avoid using 'px status'
                   check_unique   typo for fx path for configs
                                  screen out ftpd processes

                   Client.py      add sorting when validation is false
                                  dont take for granted that there are 7 fields in filename

                   Ingestor.py    filenaming standards enforced by truncating filename to 6 fields
                                  bug fix when empty fields were filled in by its extension counterpart

                   SenderFTP.py   when there is a problem delivering a file... and we were not done with it
                                  we try to delete the file on the remote site... this may hang so a timeout
				  was put there.  Instead of trying to delete both the file and its .tmp for
                                  example, a partialfile variable was defined and set to the filename 
                                  currently processed... if something goes wrong... its the one to delete

                   pxSender.1     revised

                   it with /etc/px (requiered by DL)

2008-07-17   (MG)  SenderFTP :  SFTP protocol supports umask...
                   The trick being the file is opened in w mode,

		   is written, closed  and its permission are reset at the end

2008-07-16   (DL) Add a better comment when pxRetrans is unable to create
                  to construct DB path from a filename

2008-06-26   (MG)  SenderFTP Behavior fix... when file delivery goes wrong,
                   do a preventive delete on the file. (get rid of .tmp, 
		   permission 000 file... file already there... etc)

             (MG)  Source.py and Ingestor.py   lx_script option added

2008-06-02   (MG)  Bug fix SFTP was working only with an ssh_keyfile.

2008-05-29   (DL)  Bug fix DBSearcher.py: if filesToParse is None, replaced it by []
             (DL)  In SAParser.py, FParser.py and TAFParser.py
                   1) Changed /apps/px/db/ for PXPaths.DB

                   2) In SAParser, take into accout the case where a SA bulletin contains only 1 line

2008-05-30   (MG)  Bug fix CollectionManager.py ... when observation date was incorrect, or undetermined
                   the usage of the bulletin entry emission was causing the collector to crash. Now the
                   condition is checked and we log a warning with the filepath.
