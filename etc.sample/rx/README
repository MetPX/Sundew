General:
Receivers write products received into a reception directory queue (/apps/px/rxq/<client>/*)
They receive products using a selected protocol.  Configuration files must end in
.conf, all other files are ignored by px.  For example, to disable a client, the
convention is to stop the receiver, rename the configuration file to .off and restart px.

See configuration files examples in /apps/px/etc.sample/rx/

General Options:

type (keyword, default: none  am|wmo|single-file|bulletin-file)
    am              - AM protocol socket
    wmo             - WMO protocol socket
    single-file     - Receive plain files (like a PDS)
    single-bulletin - receive bulletins in a file (ingested like from a socket)


extension  (string, default:  MISSING:MISSING:MISSING:MISSING:)           
extension tandem:-CCCC:-TT:-CIRCUIT:Direct
extension ncp1:CWAO:SA:3:Direct
    text to be added to the end of a file name to make it suitable for ingest into px.
    Five fields separted by four colons.  Substitutions are done based on the incoming msg header: 
    -CCCC       => will be replaced by the origin site
    -TT         => will be replaced by bulletin type (first 2 letters)
    -CIRCUIT    => will be replaced by priority found in header2clients.conf

    In general, we choose the extension's fields to be:
    originSystem:originSite:dataType:priority:dataFormat

    This extension + a timestamp (20051116212028) will be added to the
    ingested file or bulletin.


Socket Protocol options:

port 5012   (integer, no default)
    Port to bind for reception.

AM Socket reception specific options:

arrival CA 5 20
arrival WO 20 40
    Mapping of what the valid times to receive a given type of bulletin are.
    In this example for CA's, -5 or +20 minutes versus the issue time is 
    the valid interval. 

AddSMHeader (boolean, Default: False)
    True if a header is to be inserted at the beginning of a SM or SI bulletins.
    The header is of the form: "AAXX jjhh4\\n". 


file-reception specific options:

batch 10000   (integer, default:100 )
    The maximum number of files that will be read from disk in one cycle. 

mtime 5
    Number of seconds a file must not have been modified before we 
    read it. If set to 0, this is equivalent to not checking the 
    modification time. This option is useful for files received
    by rcp, ftp, etc. Only used when type is single-file or bulletin-file.


=========================================================================================
Developer options: 
=========================================================================================
debug (boolean, default: True)
    If we want sections with debug code (and logging informations)
    to be executed.

validation (boolean, Default: True)
    Validate if the filename have the following form:
    SACN43_CWAO_012000_CYOJ_41613:ncp1:CWAO:SA:3.A.I.E::20050201200339
    The priority field and the timestamp field are checked for validity.
    In practice, never used for sources.
    
patternMatching (boolean, Default: True)
    Determine if the masks present in the source config. file will be used for 
    routing files/bulletins.

clientsPatternMatching (boolean, Default: True)
    For receivers type that use direct routing (am, wmo, bulletin-file), 
    determine if the masks presents in the clients config. files will be used for 
    routing bulletins.

sorter (keyword, default: MultiKeysStringSorter.  others: None, StandardSorter)
    Determine which type of sorter will be used. Can be used only with type 
    single-file and bulletin-file. In practice, never used for sources.
