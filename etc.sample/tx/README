General:
 -- Configuration files must end in .conf, all other files are ignored by px.
    For example, to disable a client, rename the configuration file 
    and restart px.
 -- See examples in etc.sample/tx/

Client Directives (common to all types):

# 		can be used to start comment lines.

type <am|wmo|amis|single-file|bulletin-file>  (keyword, default: single-file)
    am              - AM protocol socket
    wmo             - WMO protocol socket
    single-file     - Receive plain files (like a PDS)
    single-bulletin - receive bulletins in a file (ingested like from a socket)

batch 10000   (integer, default: 100)
    The maximum number of files that will be read from disk between checks to the queuing 
    directories. Used with all type of clients.

emask <mask>    (exclude files matching this mask)
    the header2client.conf routing table chooses which products are queued for which clients.
    clients can override the routing table to suppress transmission by applying exclusion patterns. 

imask <mask>    (include files matching this mask)
    the header2client.conf routing table chooses which products are queued for which clients.
    clients can override the routing table to suppress transmission by applying exclusion patterns. 
    

For socket types (am, wmo, amis):

destination <URL> 
    Uniform Resource Locator to designate where a sender should connect to.
    Only ONE destination directive by client.
    
    Examples:
        destination wmo://tandem.cmc.ec.gc.ca:5012
        destination am://localhost:5012
        destination amis://123.138.212.130:5012


For FTP type (single-file):

destination <URL> <DESTFN>

    Examples:
        destination ftp://user:passwd@hostname//absolute/directory WHATFN
        destination ftp://user:passwd@hostname/relative/directory WHATFN

    There are also synonyms for subsets of 'destination'
    'protocol', 'host', 'user', 'password', 'directory', 'filename'

directory <dir>
    directory //absolute/directory
    directory /relative/directory

filename <destfn>
    filename WHATFN     (Destination name will be first part of original filename)
    filename HEADFN     (Destination name will be HEADER part of original filename)
    filename NONE       (Use the entire filename)
    filename TIME       (Timestamp appended)
    filename WHATFN:TIME


mtime 5  (number, default: 0)
    Number of seconds a file must not have been modified before we
    read it. If set to 0, this is equivalent to not checking the
    modification time. This option is useful for files received
    by rcp, ftp, etc. Normally not used for clients because the files in 
    their queues have been put there by a source in an "atomic" operation.

host atlas.cmc.ec.gc.ca  (hostname, default: localhost)
    Host with a ftp server. May be used only if type is single-file.

user toto  (string, default: None)
    User name on the ftp server of 'host'. Maybe used only if type is single-file.

passwd titi  (string, default: None)
    Password of the user titi on 'host'. Maybe used only if type is single-file.

chmod 755    (octal mode,  default: 666)
    If set to a value different than 0, umask 777 followed by a chmod of the
    value will be done. Ensure that the a process at the reception end won't be
    able to ingest the file before the transfert is finished. When 0 or not present,
    the file will be sent with a .tmp and renamed (without the .tmp) at the end of
    the transfert.
    Used only with type single-file. 

ftp_mode active (keyword,  default: passive)
    Used only with type single-file. 

dir_mkdir
    Maybe used only if type is single-file.

dir_pattern
    Maybe used only if type is single-file.

=========================================================================================

Developer Options (not for use by mere mortals):

debug (boolean, Default: False)
    If we want sections with debug code (and logging informations)
    to be executed.

validation (boolean, Default: True)
    Validate if the filename have the following form:
    SACN43_CWAO_012000_CYOJ_41613:ncp1:CWAO:SA:3.A.I.E::20050201200339
    The priority field and the timestamp field are checked for validity.

patternMatching (boolean, Default: True)
    Determine if the masks present in the client config. file will be used for
    routing the files present in the client's queue. 

noduplicates (boolean, default: True)   (applies to: socket senders)
    Senders compute checksums for bulletins sent, and place them in a send
    cache.  If the same message shows up again, it will be found in the cache.
    when noduplicates is true, senders will not send bulletins found.

sorter (keyword, default: MultiKeysStringSorter, others: None,StandardSorter)
    Determine which type of sorter will be used. Can be used with all client's types.
    MultiKeysStringSorter ensures delivery by priority and time.
