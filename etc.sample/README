The global configuration files are here:


pxRouting.conf:

pxRouting.conf is a text file with colon separated fields.  


A static routing entry is like so:

key AACN02_CWTO CMC,climate_archive,NWS,UKMETOFFICE 3

-- First field (AACN02 CWTO) is an AHL specification (TTAAii CCCC) as, indicating the AHL of messages 
   received to which this routing is to apply.
-- Second field (CMC climate_archive NWS UKMETOFFICE) is a list of tx clients to which messages with 
   the AHL should be routed.
-- Third field (3) is a priority to be assigned to an incoming message.  Higher priority messages are 
   transmitted in preference to lower priority ones.  The highest priority is 1, higher numbers indicate 
   lower priority.

Other possible routing directives in the header2client.conf file:

subclient <client> subclient1,subclient2,subclient3,subclient4

ie. 
subclient:AFTN: AACNCWAO AACNCYVR

clientAlias <aliasname> <client1>,<client2>,<client3> ...

In a static routing entry, one can use the alias to stand in for the list 
of clients.

sample clientAlias entry:

clientAlias Aviation AirTraffic,CivilAuthority,MilitaryAuthority,AFTN.AACNCYVR

A static routing entry can then be of the form:

key FPCN37_CWAO: Aviation 

to go to all Aviation clients,  including the AACNCYVR node addressed through th AFTN client.



-------------------------------
stations.conf:

stations.conf is also a text file with colon separated fields.  

A line could look like :

SACN42 CWAO:COL:CYAZ    CYBL    CYBV    CYCP CYCQ    CYDB    CYDC    CYEV    CYFO    CYHE    CYIV    CYKY    CYMD    CYPR  CYQD    CYQZ    CYRV    CYUA    CYXC    CYXE    CYXQ    CYXS    CYZP    CYZT

-- First field (SACN42 CWAO) is an AHL specification (TTAAii CCCC) as, indicating the AHL of messages 
-- Second field (COL or nothing ::) determine if the bulletins for that message type are collectables
-- Third field (space separated station name) is the alphabetically ordered station list for that message type
