INSTALL

sundew is the switching component of MetPX. 

We've only installed this internally, fully flexible packaging is
on the TODO list.  for now, this is the procedure:

requirements:
	-- kernel 2.6
	-- works best with ext3 and dir_index option enabled on file system.
	-- requires python >= 2.3  

0.   create a user & group named px

1.   create a directory with a path /apps/px
     chown it to px

2.   copy the source tree there.

3.   mkdir /apps/px/etc /apps/px/etc/tx /apps/px/etc/rx 
     mkdir /apps/px/db /apps/px/tx /apps/px/rx
     chgrp px /apps/px/db /apps/px/tx /apps/px/rx /apps/px/log
     chown px /apps/px/db /apps/px/tx /apps/px/rx /apps/px/log

     Read through the etc.sample directory to create appropriate configuration 

4.   
     su - px
     /apps/px/bin/px start.
    
5.   look at what is going on in /apps/px/log
