INSTALL

2015-08-08 REVIEW NOTE: 
      this file is obsolete. we have debian packaging for some 
      time which takes care of this.  it is just apt-get or dpkg -i now.
      update needed FIXME

sundew is the switching component of MetPX. 

We've only installed this internally, fully flexible packaging is
on the TODO list.  for now, this is the procedure:

requirements:
	-- kernel 2.6
	-- works best with ext3 and dir_index option enabled on file system.
             sample creation command:    mke2fs -j -O dir_index /dev/hda9
	-- requires python >= 2.3  
	-- to receive files via FTP, need an ftp server, such as vsftpd
           set it up to deliver into /apps/px/rx/<channel>

0.   as root in the current directory, run ./tools/pxInit
     this script does:
             0.1   create a user & group named px
             0.2   create a directory with a path /apps/px, chown it to px
             0.3   copy tree to the right place.
                   cp -rp=mode bin lib tools /apps/px
             0.4
                   mkdir /apps/px/etc /apps/px/etc/tx /apps/px/etc/rx 
                   mkdir /apps/px/db /apps/px/tx /apps/px/rx /apps/px/log
                   chgrp px /apps/px/db /apps/px/tx /apps/px/rx /apps/px/log
                   chown px /apps/px/db /apps/px/tx /apps/px/rx /apps/px/log

1.   Read through the etc.sample directory to create appropriate configuration 


2.  start sundew. 
     /apps/px/bin/px start.
    
5.   look at what is going on in /apps/px/log


P.S.  If, as a developer, you don't want to run as root, then you can:
export PXROOT=<root directory of sundew>, then run pxInit... It will 
bomb on the user creation.  You can comment that out.
