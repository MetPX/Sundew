GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The stats library's main goal is to manage stats regarding different clients and to add the possibility
to to draw graphics based on said stats.

The graphic's data is based on the data calculated from log files located remotely and saved into pickle files.

Data collection will be done locally.
 
This section thus contains all the files needed to do this job. 



Files included in the stats library are :
------------------------------------

- ClientGraphicProducer.py  
- ClientStatsPickler.py 
- cpickleWrapper.py
- DirectoryFileCollector.py    
- FileStatsCollector.py 
- generateGraphics.py
- MyDateLib.py
- pickleMerging.py
- pickleUpdater.py 
- StatsPlotter.py  
- pickleSynchroniser.py
- pickleViewer.py
- pickledTimesViewer.py
- PickleVersionChecker.py


These library files are required by the stats library :

-DateLib.py : Many methods were added specifically for the stats library, 
              but are written so they could be reused for other applications
              down the road.    

-Gnuplot library : Folder named Gnuplot containing the gnuplot library should be found in 
                   the imported libs folder of the library.
                   
                   To use imported libs the following line might be usefull in your ~/.profile
                   export PYTHONPATH=/apps/px/lib/importedLibs/

-backwardReader.py : Methods here are used to read a file backwards.

File Overview 
----------------------------                
   

-ClientGraphicProducer.py : This file contains methods to be used when a user of this class wants to produce a graphic.
                            
                            It first takes the previously collected data, then adds up the data produced between the last collection and the time of the call.
                            
                            After that it calls StatsPlotter.py with the collected data and uses it to produce the graphic.


- generateGraphics       : This file offers to the user a command line interface so he can easily use
                           the functionalities offered by ClientGraphicProducer.py. 


-ClientStatsPickler.py :      Collects stats from all the files needed to cover a certain timespace.
                              
                              File names are gathered using DirectoryFileCollector.py.
                              
                              Data for each file is collected using the methods found in FileStatsCollector.   
                    
                              Introduces the pickling principle to the library. 


                              
-DirectoryFileCollector.py  :  This file is used to gather all the interesting files present in a specific directory.  
                               
                               Search is based on fileType, client's name and timespan for wich we need data.
                                  


                           
-FileStatsCollector.py : This file contains all the methods needed to collect data from files and produce stats 
                         using said data.
                         
                         The general principle behind the data collection made here is that it's
                         always spit up into entries of a certain length.
                          
                         File entries are of a timespan selected by the user. Entries will
                         have the same width all throughout the total width the user has decided to collect data upon.                        
                         Once data has been collected, stats will be created for each buckets. This means that every bucket will have it's own min, max, median and mean values.  


-cpickleWrapper.py : very small wrapper that allows for directory creation if the path to the file name saved does not
                     exist.
                     
                     Also handles excepption when trying to open a file that does not exist.
                 
                     
-MyDateLib.py     : Temporary file wich contains date manipulation methods I have been working on. They probably should                       be addded to the regular DateLib.py once they are found to be usefull and reliable.   
                    

                                                       
-pickleMerging.py : This file contains the methods needed to combine data found in different pickle files 
                    that are covering the same time period. Example : Data that comes from the same client but from different machines.
                    
                    It also has the possibility to merge pickles covering a certain time frame. For example you could 
                    merge data coming from 12 pickles containing an hour's worth of data each into a single pickle file 
                    covering the entire 12 hours. 
                    
                    This will be very usefull if some pickles for the same client are produced on different 
                    machines and some operation concerning all the data must be done on a cpecific machine.
                    Ex :See Clientgraphicproducer...                    

-pickleUpdater.py : This program is the one to be used to make automated data updates.
                    Recommended usage is to call this program every hours to create the hourly pickles
                    the contain stats on a client. 

                                        
-StatsPlotter.py : This file contains the methods to plot a gnuplot graphic once the data has been
                   collected using the previously described files. This is very similar to the 
                   Plotter.py allready found in the library.  

                   
-PickleVersionChecker.py  : This class is used in the library to keep track of the changes made within files.
                            
                            Since pickles files are synchronised on grpahic machine they are prone to change
                            without the local machine knowing.           

                                                    
- pickleViewer.py : Allows user to view the content of a cpickle file that contains a FileStatsCollector 
                    instance. Output can be directed to a text file if wanted. 
                    
                    Very usefull for debugging, making sure data collected is stored at the right place,
                    and comparing it to the graphics produced to see if there are any differences.  

                    
- pickledTimesViewer.py: Allows users to see clearly the content of the pickled times file. 
                         Might be found usefull for debuging purpouses. 



-backwardReader.py : Contains two usefull methods for this library and possibly for other.
                     
                     -Has a readlineBackwards method that is similar to readline but that reads a file 
                      a file from the bottom up. 
                     
                     -Has a tail method that is similar to the tail used in linux but in pure python.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Log files for a specific client are often stored on many different machines.  

- Log file for a single day from a single machine can be quite large. ( average~ >30 megs )

- Log file names aren't reliable. Even if a file has a certain date in it's name it doesn't necessarily 
  mean it will contain data for that day. File content still need to be invetigated to make sure 
  it does or doesn't contain usefull info.   
 
- Gnuplot graphics, even with a lot of data are generated rather quickly. ( average~ <5 secs )

- Collecting a whole days worth of data for and producing stats according to data collected is very long.

- Disk access is very slow. Anything that has to be loaded or saved on the disk slows down the entire
  process quite a lot. 
  
- Because of the preceding, we've found out that using a single daily file would make it impossible to 
  meet the above requirements.
  
- Even with optimization, the time taken to pickle a single hour of data using a single pickle file every day
  went from three seconds for the first few hours to almost 10 seconds for the last hours of the day.    
  
- Pickling done during the final hour of the day on a machine containing 150 client would me roughly 
  150 * 10 sec = 1500  1500 /60 sec = 25 minutes dedicated to collecting data only.
  
- Saving pickled data into hourly files makes sure that time used for pickling remains stable throughout
  the day. It also makes the total amount of time much more acceptable. ~3 sec * 150 = 450 450/60 = 7.5 minutes    

- Having every machine perform the collection of the data found in the files that are present
  in it's own space makes the application must more scalable in the event that more machines and 
  or client are to be added. 


IMPLEMENTATION :
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Remote file access:
--------------------

- Remotely located pickle files are to be transfered to the machine where the graphics are to be created.
  see pickleSynchroniser.py for details. 
  
Data collection :
---------------------  

- To speed up data collection and stats production, past data collected is saved in a pickle file. 
  This way data for a specific timeframe only has to be collected and calculated once. This can save
  enormous amounts of time on graphic production if the timespan of the graphic asked by the user is
  of any importance. 
  
  FilesStatsCollector.py, DirecToryStatsCollector.py, pickleUpdater.py and gzipickle.py all contain
  methods to deal with pickled data and data pickling.
    

- Because of disk access times, data pickling can be quite slow. To speed it up cpickle has been
  added to the library. cpickle is a c based implementation of pickle that has much faster methods than 
  the usual pickle.
  
- Data collection can be done on an automated basis using crontab to call pickleUpdater.

- Data colection can be made on growing files. This is true as long as the top of the file remains
  intact and that data is only appended at the end of the log files. If top of the file is modified 
  positioning in the file will be corrupted and reading the file will probably produce errors.  

- By default all data types are collected. This is done so that there will be no problem if a user wants
  to produce any kind of graphic for a certain client.

- User can specify wich data types he wants collected but that will limit user choices for graphics.  
  
          

Graphic production
-------------------

- Graphics are produced using StatsPlotter.py. It's simply a modified version of Plotter.py
  wich was allready working and available in the library.
  
- Graphics can be produced by calling ??? in ClientGraphicProducer.py.
  
  The graphic drawn will have the timespan width specified by the user.
  
  If the now option is used, data will be collected up to the time of the last crontab call to
  pickleUpdater. In that case it will be drawn up to the minute at wich it was called and thus have
  the new data included.( Not yet implemented. )
  
  Otherwise, the graphic's data will not include data after the last crontab 
  call but will be drawn faster since no time will be spent on collecting and calculating new data.
      
-It is now possible to produce graphics for each data type collected. This means latency,bytecount 
 and errors.  

-It is impossible to create a graphic on a data type wich was not previously collected. 
 This is why by default all types are collected and pickled. This allows users to have access 
 to every data type possible. 



Dealing with remote machines
-----------------------------

- To make the application more scalable in terms of a possible growing number of machines it was 
  decided that every machines would do it's own data pickling using pickleUpdater. 

- Some clients have their data stored on different machines. This prompted the implementation
  of a rsync system that allows pickled data found on numerous machines to be brought back 
  in a single folder of a specific machine if needed. 

- ClientGraphicProducer uses that system to produce graphics for a certain client where the user wants 
  to have the data from more than one machine.(todo)       

- pickleMerging.py has been introduced in the library to make merging of different machines pickles
  possible.
  
     
  
 
Important notes ( Specifics )
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using the pickleUpdater to make automatic updates, data collection will start where the last 
data Collection was made. If no pickling at all was made for that client, it will start at xx:00:00
of that the hour specified.   

Data pickling a client thats not listed in PICKLED-TIMES can only be done within the same hour.
If data needs to be collected in a previous hour, you need to specify the day in the call to pickleUpdater
call. ***See usage for details.  

Data pickling can otherwise be done over numerous days. This means that if no pickling occured for a few 
days for some reason, pickling can be resumed like nothing happened although first pickle update will be 
quite long. 

While using the higher level pickleUpdater and ClientGraphicProducer classes, time buckets and 
pickle files will be created on a much more rigid daily basis.

    - A FileStatsCollector instance will be created every hour and contain time buckets starting at 
      xx:00:00 that hour and ending at xx:59:59. 
    
    - Pickle will dave each daily instance in a file named after the client's name and the date of 
      the pickle. 
      
    - Every hour, a new pickle will be created to contain the new FileStatscollector entry.     


Graphics cannot be produced for a data type wich was not previously collected for that client. 

If need be, PICKLED-TIMES can be modified so that library thinks last pickle update occured at a
different time than was written.   


File system 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Log Files 
---------
The file wich contains the data we want to collect and calculate needs to have a specific format. 

This means that all file entries should have the following syntax : 

....to be completed when exact log format is chosen....




Pickle Files :
---------------


PICKLED-TIMES :
--------------
This is the only file created to contain all the last pickleUpdates times from each of the different 
clients. This file is save in a regular non-compresses pickle format. This is done so that a user 
could easily modify a certain client's date if needed.




/apps/px/stats/pickles/clientName/YYYYMMDD/fileType/machineName_hh
------------------------------ 

These file are created to save the data collected for the period covering the hour specified 
in the file's name.  This file contains a FileStatsCollector instance containing all the data
collected for that hour saved with cpickleWrapper.py.
 
These files will be grouped in a folder named pickles. This folder will contain many subfolder, all of wich
named after a certain clients name. Theses folder will contain all the pickle files of that client.

-------------------------------------  
The files are created everytime a graphic is asked for by a user. This will be the png image containing all the graphics asked for by the user during his resquest.  It will contain graphs for each of the data types asked for as many clients as specified. 

These files will be grouped in a folder named graphs(?). This folder will contain many subfolder, all of wich named after a certain clients name. Theses folder will contain all the image files of that client.

REMOTE PICKLE FILE SYNCHRONISATION
-----------------------------------        
As stated above, central server wich produces graphics must do so in a rather short period of time.

This implies that it can only waste a very small amount gathering the remotely located pickle files from 
every machines. 

We have thus implemented a file synchronisation mechanism using RSYNC wich allows the server to keep
up to date version of the pickle files. RSYNC Update must be set using a cron call to pickleSynchroniser.py.

This file will update pickles from every server unless specified otherwise in parameters.        
        
        
USAGE:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1- See the howTo.txt file contained in this folder.
2- Most files whos name start with a lower case letter can be executed with a -h option to get usage.
3- All .py files are rather heavily commented within their code.
