Description:MetPX is a message switching system for use with  Wmo  Global
 Telecommunications System circuits based on TCP/IP. Developed at
 the Canadian Meteorological Centre of Environment Canada for our
 own use. 
 MetPX is a work in progress, the development process is being
 externalized in the hopes of fostering a community around a
 switching system which all can share and improve together. The
 system is already production quality for a limited set of features
 and is in production use at the CMC as the core of our national
 bulletin switching infrastructure. The software is under continuous,
 but low-intensity development. Features are carefully being layered
 on top of existing stable functions.
